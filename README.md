 ## Project {1} {Palindrome checker}
/* 
* Conditions:
* palindrome :  a word, verse, or sentence (such as "Able was I ere I saw Elba") or a number (such as 1881) that reads the same backward or forward
* Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
* A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
* Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
* We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.
* We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.

 ## Project {2} {United States Telephone Number Validator}
  * Telephone Number Validator
* Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

* The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers :

* 555-555-5555
* (555)555-5555
* (555) 555-5555
* 555 555 5555
* 5555555555
* 1 555 555 5555
* For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.
